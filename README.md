# Hangman 

A less morbid twist on the classic Hangman game. 
Built using React and Redux Toolkit. 




## How to play

Aim of the game:

Guess the correct secret word before you run out of chances. You have 8 chances to guess the correct word.

- To start a new game, click start game.
- The number of dashes represent the length of the word you have to guess.
- For each right letter you guess correctly, the letter will be added to the word.
- For each incorrect letter you guess, the letter will go into the wrong letters box and the hangman will lose a balloon.
- When there are no balloons left, you lose the game.
- If you can guess the word before you run out of balloons, you win.
- You start with 8 balloons.
